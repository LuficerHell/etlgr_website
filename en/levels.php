        SLA

      <div class="levels__text">
        <p>We have a 99.99% availability SLA guaranteed by our infrastructure partner Microsoft and the same value from the <a href="#">Swanager software</a>. So that means <span class="bold">4 minutes*</span>  downtime max in month (30 days, 24/7) for Website or Bot. All the emails in this period are going to be delivered, because we have a reliable queue service to process the whole traffic.</p>
        <p class="cursive"> 4 minutes means 4 minutes  <span class="bold">max</span>, so for now the max downtime we’ve ever had is 3 mins, and it was because of a massive DDoS attack;</p>
